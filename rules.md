# **Burke's Gambit Engine Power-Up Table (d20)**

> Each time an engine power-up is rolled, the player who rolled it then rolls a
> 20-sided die and resolves the result they rolled on the table below. **Most
> abilities are optional to use, and none of them can be cancelled, copied, or
> affected.** After the player resolves the ability, play continues as normal.

**1 - Hull Breach :** Everyone at full health loses one life [MANDATORY]
