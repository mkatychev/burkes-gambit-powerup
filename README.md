I have added to Rob Yates' recently uploaded Power-Up Table. This one requires a d20, and involves a few house rules.

1. When a power-up is rolled, the d20 is rolled and this power-up table is consulted
1. All of these power-up results are optional EXCEPT Hull Breach and Wormhole
1. The character role (ability) cards remain hidden until they are used
1. All the unused extra role cards are placed in the middle of the table
1. For the Communications Officer, if a special face is rolled, they can reveal their role card and change the special face to any other special face.
